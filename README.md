# CabBooking

For our online cab booking market analysis project, we collected a dataset focused on customer reviews and ratings, conducted exploratory data analysis, applied clustering and classification techniques to gain insights, and documented the entire process in a report. I also created a dedicated GitHub repository to share my work with the team, demonstrating our commitment to the project's success and individual efforts in contributing to data-driven decision-making.
